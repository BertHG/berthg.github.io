I am Bert Verschaeve. I'm an Applied Informatics student at the University College in Ghent, but currently I am on erasmus in Czech Republic. I study here at the Technical University in Ostrava. The field of study here is Telecommunications.

### System and Network engineer

In our school after 1.5 year, we have to choose a study direction. You can choose between programming (web, mobile), system and network engineer and mainframe. I chose system and network engineer, so a lot of posts on this blog will revolve around this subject. At this moment my courses in Ghent are Enterprise Linux (automation with Ansible) and Windows Server. In Czech Republic my subjects are Practice in Communication Networks (Syslog, Monitoring, Authentication,...), VoIP, Access Networks (xDSL, cable,fiber, LTE, Zigbee, LoRa,...) and Advanced Network Technologies (MPLS, VPNs,...)

### Hobby's

Informatics is not my only hobby. I like photography and music, so maybe some posts will be about this.
